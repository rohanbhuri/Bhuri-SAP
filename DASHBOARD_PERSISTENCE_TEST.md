# Dashboard Persistence Test Guide

## What was implemented:

1. **Context Persistence**: Dashboard now remembers whether user selected "Personal" or an organization
2. **Organization Selection Persistence**: When an organization is selected, it's remembered across sessions
3. **Compact View Persistence**: The compact/normal view toggle is also remembered
4. **Validation**: Invalid saved contexts (e.g., deleted organizations) are automatically cleared

## Backend Fix Applied:

- Fixed `auth.controller.ts` to use `req.user.userId` instead of `req.user.id` 
- This resolves the "User not found" error when updating organization

## How to Test:

### Test 1: Organization Selection Persistence
1. Login to the dashboard
2. Select an organization from the dropdown (not "Personal")
3. Refresh the page
4. ✅ **Expected**: The same organization should still be selected

### Test 2: Personal Mode Persistence  
1. Login to the dashboard
2. Select "Personal" from the dropdown
3. Refresh the page
4. ✅ **Expected**: "Personal" should still be selected

### Test 3: Compact View Persistence
1. Click the menu (⋮) in the dashboard header
2. Toggle to "Compact View"
3. Refresh the page
4. ✅ **Expected**: Dashboard should still be in compact view

### Test 4: Invalid Context Handling
1. Select an organization and refresh (to save it)
2. Have an admin delete that organization from backend
3. Refresh the dashboard
4. ✅ **Expected**: Should fallback to "Personal" or user's default organization

### Test 5: Cross-Session Persistence
1. Select an organization
2. Close the browser completely
3. Open browser and login again
4. ✅ **Expected**: Previously selected organization should be restored

## Technical Implementation:

- Uses `localStorage` for client-side persistence
- Keys used:
  - `dashboard-context`: Stores selected context (personal/org ID)
  - `dashboard-compact-view`: Stores compact view preference
- Validation ensures saved contexts are still valid
- Graceful fallback to defaults when saved data is invalid

## Files Modified:

1. `frontend/src/app/pages/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts`
   - Added localStorage persistence methods
   - Added context validation
   - Added initialization logic

2. `backend/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
   - Fixed user ID reference bug

## Error Handling:

- localStorage errors are caught and logged (for SSR compatibility)
- Invalid organization IDs are detected and cleared
- User-friendly error messages for API failures
- Automatic fallback to safe defaults
