### 3. Module Activation
The CRM module is configured as a public module, meaning:

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Backend: Add new endpoints in `CrmController`
2. Backend: Extend `CrmService` with business logic
3. Frontend: Update `CrmService` for API calls
4. Frontend: Extend components as needed

### Customization

- Input validation on all API endpoints

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile app support
- Third-party CRM integrations
- Automated workflows
- AI-powered lead scoring
